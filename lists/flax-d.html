The menu would be about the size of a typical fast food restaurant&rsquo;s menu to keep drive-through times and stocking manageable. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unique Selling Proposition (what makes it different / unique): </span><span>The fastest way to get a meal is a drive-thru, and yet most drive-thru meals aren&rsquo;t the type of food people are hoping to serve their families. And yet, parents are often feeling the time crunch - not to mention the getting everyone in and out of the car crunch, that keeps them from cooking a healthy dinner. Also, maybe there could be sections people drive through, like sections of the supermarket - like there could be a produce microphone, protein microphone&hellip; or the express, whole package lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Revenue Stream:</span><span>&nbsp;Selling products / Franchising fees</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">#4 - Dial-a-digital Native </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Resource Available: </span><span>Bootstrapper</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Outline the Idea (what it is/who it&rsquo;s for): </span><span>A dial-up service to walk older people through more basic IT problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unique Selling Proposition (what makes it different / unique): </span><span>This would be for the type of problem that you don&rsquo;t need a highly trained IT professional for. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing your kids or grandkids could help with if they were around more - downloading pictures from email, setting up a Facebook account, learning to use a new device. This would help older people stay in the loop in a world where no one sends paper pictures anymore.
