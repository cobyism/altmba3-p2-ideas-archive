To then think that they have an extra 3 hours every night to review and assess assignments is ludicrous. What if they were able to get help with reviewing and assessing homework, get a report on students and then do the valuable work of engaging and teaching the students that need help? We propose using underworked teachers/substitutes/college students to do exactly that. Revenue would come from the school system.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Peer-to-peer topic based help site for students: </span><span>We all fear looking dumb. No one more than sensitive children and teens struggling with schoolwork.

Users would create profiles of their measurements, brand preferences and evaluate the fit of clothes they have (i.e. I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo; 1&rdquo;, 200lbs and like things with a trim fit. My Levi&rsquo;s 511 34x32 fit me like a glove but don&rsquo;t crush my man berries). Other users can then search for well-fitting clothing based on similar sized humans. Searches would provide offsite links to clothing that fits the stated parameters of the shopper. Money to be made via referral links to online retailers. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">MyHealth: </span><span>Knowing what is happening with multiple healthcare/dental/eyecare/etc accounts is maddening. We want to create an o</span><span>nline service to aggregate all healthcare/medical accounts/billing and provide clarity and assistance in understanding a complicated industry by bringing it all together in one place.

And the simple act of adding a new filter to your air system or adding house plants is an easy way to give yourself the best to breathe. We propose a service that c</span><span>omes to a users house, look at/replaces furnace filter and adds a &ldquo;scientifically&rdquo; determined right amount of easy-to-care for plants to improve air quality. Revenue comes from the service itself, from premium furnace filters (HEPA, etc) and from on-going plant maintenance options.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Date Night:</span><span>&nbsp;When you&rsquo;ve got a job, a kid and many other responsibilities, sometimes the hardest thing to do is take time for yourself and your loved one. We propose creating an app that dramatically simplifies the process of creating the weekly or bi-weekly date night adventure by doing the work for you. Users would simply enter time available, budget and travel radius, a random date is created for you to select. Revenue would come from a percentage of the cost of the date (i.e. 5% of cost of movie tickets and average dinner at restaurant) and potentially though partnership referrals with with Care.com or similar to cover babysitting.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">WellPlated:</span><span>&nbsp;Food trackers act as a diary of what you eat, but they seem to miss the opportunity to interpret that information and provide simple, positive tips on how to eat better based on what you have been eating. We propose creating a recipe app to tie in with food trackers to identify patterns and suggest healthier tweaks to unhealthy meals. For example, if you eat mac and cheese 2x a week, it would suggest that you try replacing noodles with quinoa to get X/Y/Z benefits. By also providing coupons for recommended product types, revenue could be created from from ads, links to recipe sites or even promotion of FreshDirect/healthy meal services. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">UpNext:</span><span>&nbsp;Everyone&rsquo;s got a Netflix queue.

But so is looking straight down at the smartphone in your hand. We propose creating a p</span><span>osture checking app that can run in the background of your OS to monitor phone usage and position of phone screen to infer angle of sight. Once aware that you are Text Necking, app would send you an alert and provide tips and reminders to straighten up. Concerned users could purchase the app on their own or we could even sell/license it to a healthcare provider looking to reduce repetitive motion injuries and looking for innovative solutions. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Auto Update:</span><span>&nbsp;Regular maintenance of your automobile is key to keeping it running. Regularly getting into your car and driving to the shop when nothing seems to be wrong with your vehicle? A huge pain in the ass. We propose creating a service that schedules your maintenance at the service location of your choice, comes to you to take your car in for 30/60/90k servicing and returns it to you. Revenue could come either directly from customers or by partnering with luxury auto makers as a built in service option for a premium market. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">ArtMeUp: </span><span>Ever been to a house with nothing on the walls? Feels unlived in. While some of us have time, desire and funds to seek out great art and design our homes...some of us don&rsquo;t. We propose building a service that simplifies this process by enabling users to s</span><span>nap pics of rooms to be filled, provide sizes of open areas, define </span><span>desired </span><span>color palette, and budget limits and in return get a personalized, cohesive set of unique art pieces to fill their home. Revenue comes from the service itself and could be improved by offering higher tier or limited edition pieces for an extra cost. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">ErgoHome:</span><span>&nbsp;We all know the modern worker is killing their body by sitting in a desk every day, all day. But our supposition is that the home experience of a modern human isn&rsquo;t much different. Slouching is slouching at work or at home. We propose designing and deploying an in-home ergonomics assessment and optimization session that looks at everything from dining tables to tv placement and more. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">iWater: </span><span>One core piece of modern advice &gt; Drink dat water. One core struggle of modern humans &gt; Drinking dat water. While many of us have the ever present water bottle, the limited size of our usual flask frames the amount of water we are recommended to drink in a false manner. We see what we have but not what we don&rsquo;t. We propose building a wifi connected, countertop water tank that fills up every morning with the recommended amount of clean, cool, filtered water. Throughout the day it will remind you to have a cup and feel the fluid via smartphone reminders, wearables notifications and even proximity detecting alerts that cause the tank to flash when an under-hydrated owner is near. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Prescribed Prescriptions:</span><span>&nbsp;As we age many of us find ourselves with myriad bottles of pills to take in different amounts on different days. It&rsquo;s confusing, overwhelming and unnecessary. We propose offering an in-home (or pharmacy side) p</span><span>ill cutting and provisioning service that correctly allocates your medications, provides them to you by day/time/etc and ensures nothing is missed or amiss. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Paleo Grocery Store/Convenience Store:</span><span>&nbsp;Eating healthy can be easy. You just have to cut out the shit. Which makes going to the grocery store hard. Modern consumerism has packed the middle with pre-packaged, stabilizer saturated food products. So cut them out and make it impossible to make a bad decision. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Full Cycle Pill Management: </span><span>A major issue in the fight against antibiotic resistance is that many patients stop taking their medication when they feel better, not when the prescribed course of meds is done. This leads to stronger bacteria that no longer respond to current antibiotics. We propose creating a &ldquo;connected&rdquo; pill bottle or pack that monitors the prescription and only pays the insurance portion of a prescription claim when patient takes all pills. This puts pressure on the patient to follow through and ensures lower costs and reduced health issues for providers. Monetization would happen via licensing of the product/platform to prescription management companies. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Pay as you grow, bro, a use-based gym membership: </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>Today&rsquo;s gyms often offer everything to everyone. Weights, cardio, classes, saunas, etc. But we don&rsquo;t all use all of the amenities, so should we pay for them? We propose zoning different parts of the gym and charging users different amounts based on what they use. Overhead and staff would be covered and investments could be made where interest is clear. Also offers the opportunity for members to tests of other sections for free and the gym can grow subscription revenue from there. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Schoose:</span><span>&nbsp;Incentivized shoe pricing. Customers bring in used shoes, get credit for new ones. Used ones donated and used as tax deduction or sold/donated in other countries.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Pre-emptive Bill Explanation: </span><span>Create a service for healthplans, utilities, cable companies, etc and actively call customers to offer help understanding their bills. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Growing: </span><span>Create an eco-conscious progressive baby and parental education subscription box service.

Not everyone knows exactly how or what their options are. Our service would s</span><span>et up home pc theater/streaming boxes and connect customers to services. Revenue would come from the install and on-going support services.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Honey, I&rsquo;m Home!:</span><span>&nbsp;Ever had to search around on your hands in knees outside in the snow at 4am because you didn&rsquo;t know where your water main shut off valve was? Now you won&rsquo;t have to with our new home owner how to intro service. We come to your house and show you the location and overview of operation of all of your major appliances and systems. Revenue on a per walkthrough basis with potential for referal revenue to local plumbers/electricians/etc. </span></li><li class="c2"><span>Auto transcription of patient visits with human checking. Analyze patterns in convos. Recos and insight. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">WellKit:</span><span>&nbsp;When you need a bandage you need a bandage, so shouldn&rsquo;t you have one? WellKit is a subscription medicine cabinet service run off IoT. We created the perfect collection of home medical objects and put them into a slick, self-contained kit. That&rsquo;s connected to the internet. And knows when something is almost out. And automatically orders it for you. Initial purchase and subscription stocking revenue streams. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">All Night Normal Clinic:</span><span>&nbsp;Many of us either work all day or work at night, so how is it that the services we need, including vital health care services, are only open during the day or via Emergency Rooms. We would open a normal doctor and pharmacy at night at regular rates.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Video chat add on module for healthcare apps: </span><span>More and more patients have smartphones with apps and more and more healthcare providers are creating apps for those smartphones. In an effort to cut cost and improve patient access, video services are being utilized. We would carve out a focus on building a video chatting service and offer it to healthcare providers, doctors and clinics for a subscription. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Patient Advocate For Hire:</span><span>&nbsp;Many of us are intimidated when going to the doctor and either don&rsquo;t always know the right questions to ask, or don&rsquo;t ask them out of fear. Our service would offer informed advocates who would accompany you to your appointment and ensure your opinion is being expressed and ensure you understand the information being shared with you and options in front of you. Revenue would come either from patients who purchase the service individually or from healthcare plans/providers who subscribe. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">Second opinion.</span><span>&nbsp;Sometimes in life, you don&rsquo;t need a friend, a parent or a therapist, you just need the opinion of a pretty sharp person who doesn&rsquo;t know you. Our service would offer time-slot based advice via phone calls. Callers would talk to an impartial person. Not a therapist, a sounding board. Revenue generated per call/time-slot. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c1">GymTime time-slot based gym:</span><span>&nbsp;Often when you don&rsquo;t have an appointment, you don&rsquo;t go. Our concept would offer customers hour-long slots at a gym. Customers would be limited in total and could only attend the gym during their purchased hours. Revenue from time-slot purchase, sliding scale for peak vs off hours. </span></li></ol><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span></span></p></body></html>
