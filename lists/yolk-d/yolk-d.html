Each one is potentially the seed of something big. But this was the easy part. Tending to one and letting it grow is much harder, and more&nbsp;remarkable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Why is the work valuable to those customers? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The advantage over a paper book is weight, thickness, and catalog diversity. The advantage over existing ebook readers is tangibility (you can give a book as a physical gift), resale value, simplicity (one reader always == one book). </span></p>

<h2><b>13. Language Article of the day</b></h2>
<p><b>Purpose:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Help language users by letting them sign up for one article a day. Tapping on a word gives the definition, and there is an easy way to give feedback saying the article was too hard, too easy, or just right.</span></p>

<p><b>Purpose:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s scary to find someone to practice with in person. This app anonymously connects you to other language learners and gives you some context to chat about. You rate your interaction to weed out spammers and establish trust. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Language Learners</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Who are the customers? </b></p>

<h2><b>41. PodMaster Inc.</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Purpose: &nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We provide superior intelligence to podcasters (and thus their advertisers) about listener analytics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because it allows them to track and analyze their listener data which they can then benchmark against the industry, and use to set fair advertising rates. It also provides superior listener data. For example – when did the listener play/pause/fast forward/skip? The current data available is often no better than # of downloads, which doesn’t say much. &nbsp;We even have the technology to bid out relevant ads in timed slots based on user preferences, like google ads but for podcasts.</span></p>

<p><b>How do you make money? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Podcasters pay us for a subscription to our analytics service. In addition, we can manage their “slotted ads” if they would like, for a fee. And we aggregate and analyze all industry data and sell anonymized reports to both podcasters and advertisers.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Why is the work valuable to those customers? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You wake up in the morning and feel “mellow” and “outdoorsy” and the app gives you a recommendation for a nice walking loop by the river that ends at a coffee shop you have enjoyed in the past. Or you feel “extroverted” and “energetic” and the app, knowing you like basketball, recommends a basketball meetup at the local community center in 45 minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Imagine a beautiful e-ink calendar on your wall, that automatically updates based on your google calendar. Or an e-ink “newspaper” on your kitchen table that automatically populates the front page with recommended content based on what you’ve saved in your evernote. Or an e-ink personal recipe book that shows the latest recipes you’ve bookmarked. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How do you make money? </b></p>
