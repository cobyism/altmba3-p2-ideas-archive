Concierge setup of third-party digital tools </span></h2><p class="c3"><span>With so many third-party digital tools, web apps, and services available (A/B split testing platforms, email marketing apps, marketing automation tools, user tracking, performance tracking, content tracking, customer support platforms, etc.), it&rsquo;s really hard for business owners&mdash;who may be an expert in their business, and as a result haven&rsquo;t had the time to research and understand all the tools that are available to them&mdash;to know A) what tools might suit their needs B) how to go about setting them up, integrating them correctly with their business, and C) how to each tool in conjunction with the other tools to actually get useful insights and in-real-life business results at the end of the day. Create a business that is positioned as an expert in all the third-party tools available, their capabilities, their integration points, and sell that knowledge to businesses as a concierge service tailored to each specific client&rsquo;s business goals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><h2 class="c3 c9"><a id="h.2dz4x5rdiwyu" name="h.2dz4x5rdiwyu"></a><span>35. #altCS course </span></h2><p class="c3"><span>Create and plan an alternative course (altMBA-style) for people to learn advanced technology skills that will enable them to design, build, launch and maintain technical products like web apps, mobile apps, and the database systems and infrastructure that power them. </span></p><h2 class="c3 c9"><a id="h.jijzkkvmzfgc" name="h.jijzkkvmzfgc"></a><span>36. Work-out in a box </span></h2><p class="c3"><span>Curate a package of simple products that are effective for enabling people to work out from home. Instead of bulky gym equipment that has to be set up permanently, focus on small, lightweight, adaptable apparatus like pull-up bars that can be easily installed on the door frame, elastic resistance bands, hand grippers for improving grip/forearm strength, portable kettlebells that can be filled with water or sand and emptied for travel/shipment, a roll-up mat that can be used to transform any space into a stretch/workout area and then put away again, and so forth. Create a simple, modular companion guide for how people can design their own workout plans that match their ability and situation. People get value from this package because it saves them having to become an expert themselves on A) what&rsquo;s possible to do without expensive machines or weights that are impractical to ship and B) it&rsquo;s a package that&rsquo;s designed to work together, with different things to target different areas of the body.</span></p><h2 class="c3 c9"><a id="h.38p0615ezofv" name="h.38p0615ezofv"></a><span>37. To-do list app for GTD die-hards </span></h2><p class="c3"><span>Build a to-do/task management application specifically for the &ldquo;Getting Things Done&rdquo; methodology (created by David Allen) and the thousands of die-hard fanatics who swear by that methodology. Differentiation is easy, since while most popular to-do apps can be used in some way to facilitate the GTD method, none of them are built from the ground up to work in that way, and that way only. Capitalize on the enthusiasm within that community to help spread the word about the app.</span></p><h2 class="c3 c9"><a id="h.e4opp13lpeze" name="h.e4opp13lpeze"></a><span>38.

Car wash as a subscription </span></h2><p class="c3"><span>Create a network of car wash/valet service providers, and allow community residents to sign up for a monthly subscription to have their car&rsquo;s washed, and optionally valeted too, for a set price, every month.

Service providers benefit from having much more predictable utilization and thus income. This is essentially a double-sided market model, but the actual service providers are &ldquo;masked&rdquo; behind the subscription business&rsquo;s brand. The business takes a cut of each subscription.</span></p><h2 class="c4"><a id="h.he2nlvbjdqoq" name="h.he2nlvbjdqoq"></a><span>40.

Due to the (significant) inherent constraints involved with doing anything in the banking industry, let alone anything progressive, none of the international businesses tackling this space have been able to branch out of their own regulatory environment, because of the huge investment they&rsquo;ve had to make in tailoring their business to function in their native jurisdiction. There is room to create a business along these lines in the UK, since nobody has made a serious go of it here yet. By not having branches, the business can direct capital to other tasks that are more important to people in this day-and-age&mdash;namely, having clear control and transparency into their accounts, and having access to tools that legitimately help them save and generally be smart with their money (esp. in automatic ways).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">99. Art dealership online</span></p><p class="c5"><span>A platform for artists to display and sell their work directly. But this has strong categorisations so it is easy for customers to search their type of painting and find appropriate artists. For example, if a customer wanted something contemporary with a french flair, there would be specific for this. Each artist would need to categorise their art. Each piece would be sold with a certificate of authenticity that it is sold direct from the artist. Part of the offer is logistics to move the art safely and securely. Customers have the benefit of seeing art directly from the source. One established commission could be arranged through the site as well. Revenues would be a margin and fees on art sold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">100. The best for last!
